# RunwayExample-24ways

These are the Perch Runway templates for 24ways.org, as it stood summer 2015.

Each reqest gets routed to a file in the `templates/pages` folder.

This was a site that started out on Perch before being ported to Perch Runway. As such there are plenty of improvements to make to make full use of the functionality. It's not the cleanest of structures, and could benefit from going back over to refactor before the 2015 advent run.
